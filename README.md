## Overview

Captioneer is built to provide easy-to-use tools and reference notebooks for generating natural-language captions for images. It demonstrates typical image-captioning workflows including data preprocessing, model training, inference, and evaluation.

## Features

- Notebook-driven experiments for rapid prototyping
- Preprocessing utilities for common captioning datasets
- Training recipes and evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU, CIDEr)
- Example inference scripts / notebook to generate captions from images

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/Pzhvk/Captioneer.git
   cd Captioneer

2. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the notebooks or run the scripts

   jupyter lab

## Usage

Notebook: Open the included Jupyter notebooks and run the cells in order. Notebooks are the recommended way to explore data, models, and inference steps.

Script (example):

```bash
python scripts/generate_caption.py --image path/to/image.jpg --model path/to/model.ckpt
```

The script should output a human-readable caption for the provided image. Replace paths with your local file locations.

## Notebooks

This repo is focused around Jupyter notebooks (see the `notebooks/` directory). Notebooks typically include:

- Data loading and preprocessing examples
- Model definition and training loops
- Inference examples and visualization of generated captions

## Training & Models

- Training recipes and checkpoints, if included, are typically under `models/` or described in the notebooks.
- Use the notebooks to run training on a GPU-enabled machine for reasonable performance.

## Data

Common datasets used with this repository include COCO and Flickr30k. For experimentation, you can use small subsets of these datasets locally. See the notebooks for dataset download and preprocessing instructions.

## Evaluation

Standard captioning metrics are supported (BLEU, CIDEr, METEOR, ROUGE-L). Evaluation scripts / notebook cells will compute these metrics comparing generated captions to reference captions.

## Repository Structure
